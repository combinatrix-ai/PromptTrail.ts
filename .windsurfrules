- Port Python PromptTrail to TypeScript with TypeScript-first design:
  - Use type inference, generics, and TS-specific features
  - Follow TS best practices and idioms
- Use `pnpm` for package management
- Run tests with `cd packages/core && pnpm exec vitest --run --watch=false`
- Use latest models:
  - OpenAI: `gpt-4o-mini`
  - Anthropic: `claude-3-5-haiku-latest`
- Note: Library is in development
- You're talking with the library developer. So, don't hesitate to fix the core code.
- Current implementation may have bugs
- Investigate core code if results are unexpected
